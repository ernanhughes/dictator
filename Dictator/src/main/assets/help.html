<h2>
    <b>What it does</b>
</h2>

<p>
    Android Guard checks all the installed applications on your device and displays the permissions
    that they are requesting for their operation.
</p>

<h2>
    <b>How does this help me?</b>
</h2>

<p>
    By looking at the permissions each application requests you can make an informed decision on
    whether that application poses a security risk.
</p>

<h2>
    <b>What happens when I see an application requesting too many permissions?</b>
</h2>

<p>
    Your safest bet is to just uninstall the application. Or at least consider alternatives.
    Sometimes applications required enhanced permissions to operate for example GMail will need
    access to
    your account information. A launcher application will require a lot of system permissions. In
    general the
    less permissions an applications uses the safer it is.
</p>

<h2>
    <b>But I really like application DodgeyApp that requests permission
        EMAIL_ALL_MY_CONTACTS?</b>
</h2>

<p>
    Check similar applications to see do they share the same permission. Consider trying one of the
    alternatives. You could also email the developer and ask them why they are requesting the
    permission.
</p>


<h2>
    <b>I don't understand a permission an application is requesting?</b>
</h2>

<p>
    Vanguard includes detailed help on each permission and the associated risks. If you cannot
    find the information here try Googling for help.
</p>

<h2>
    <b>How does Android Guard calculate the rating for each application?</b>
</h2>

<p>
    We use a really simple technique. We give all applications a 100% rating and remove a percentage
    for
    each permission that can affect a user. This makes for a very simple comparison BUT it will lead
    to
    lower marks for applications that require enhanced permissions.
<ol>
    <li>Every app starts with a rating of 100%</li>
    <li>For each developer permission Vanguard removes 5%</li>
    <li>For each custom application permission Vanguard removes 5%</li>
    <li>For each permission that affects a users privacy Vanguard removes 3%</li>
    <li>For each System permission Vanguard removes 3%</li>
    <li>For each Security permission Vanguard removes 2%</li>
    <li>For each Social permission Vanguard removes 2%</li>
</ol>


</p>
<p>
    All other permissions we rate as 0%. For example most application will require access to the
    network and or internet to function but
    should not require access to your contacts.
</p>

<h2>
    <b>I see a permission with description Unknown Permission?</b>
</h2>

<p>
    Some application have custom security permissions that are outside the android standard. Also
    Android adds new permissions on each upgrade. If you have an issue send us an email at
    support@droidguard.mobi
    and we will try to sort it out.
</p>

<h2>
    <b>I don't agree with th way you rate applications?</b>
</h2>

<p>
    In a later version we may customize the rating process or we may enhance it so that social media
    applcations ar ento unfairly penalised.
